The "Students Management" website aims to implement various programming languages to create a user-friendly interface, enabling users to access a student database. It is designed to manage student information, providing a centralized platform for administering their data. From registering and editing students' personal information to viewing their details and managing attached files, the platform offers a wide range of functionalities.

For the development and styling of this site, several programming languages were used, including Python Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, and SQL, as well as design platforms such as Canva and Color Palette Chooser.
